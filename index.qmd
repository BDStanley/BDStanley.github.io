::: {#hero-heading}

I am Associate Professor in the Centre for the Study of Democracy at the SWPS University of Social Sciences and Humanities. A political scientist and sociologist, I received a PhD in Government from the University of Essex and have previously worked at the Institute for Public Affairs in Bratislava, the Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski University in Warsaw, and the University of Sussex in Brighton, United Kingdom. I am currently conducting research into the politics of populism, illiberalism and authoritarianism in Central and Eastern Europe. My forthcoming monograph "Good Change: The Rise and Fall of Poland's Illiberal Revolution" (co-authored with Stanley Bill) will be published by Stanford University Press in September 2025.
